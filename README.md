## Developing

Get all services running:

```sh
docker-compose up graph-node
```

This command will build and start a graph instance, ganache, IPFS and postgresql.

Before being able to use these services, you need to deploy the DAOStack contracts and configure the graph node to listen to changes:
```sh
npm run setup-env
```

To run the tests, run:
```sh
npm run test
```

After you are done, run:
```
docker-compose down -v
```

If you update the subgraph dependency in `package.json`, you must rebuild the containers and re-configure the graph node:
```
docker-compose build
npm run setup-env
```

### Commands


 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
 - `npm run test`: run the tests
 - `npm run test:stress`: run the a test suite that opens and checks the functioning of many websockets
